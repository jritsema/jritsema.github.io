I wrote this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/scaling-iac-and-ci-cd-pipelines-with-terraform-github-actions-and-aws-proton/) to explore how AWS Proton streamlines the deployment and scaling of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and CI/CD pipelines in AWS environments. It highlights how AWS Proton enables platform engineers to create reusable templates for provisioning containerized web applications and CI/CD pipelines using services like Amazon ECS Fargate and GitHub Actions. By leveraging Proton templates, developers can self-service deploy their applications while adhering to organizational standards for security and cost optimization. The post walks through an example using Terraform to set up a Python Flask application, demonstrating Proton's flexibility in maintaining, updating, and scaling infrastructure templates over time.
