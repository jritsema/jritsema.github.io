Hey there! I'm John Ritsema, a Principal Solutions Architect at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) based in Marietta, Georgia. As a lifelong learner with a passion for solving complex technical challenges, I specialize in AI, containers, DevOps, internal developer platforms, and distributed systems. Throughout my career, I've earned a software patent, led major enterprise modernization initiatives, and built platforms handling hundreds of thousands of requests per second.

My career journey spans IT consulting and roles at Turner Broadcasting and WarnerMedia, and now AWS. I am dedicated to helping organizations build resilient, scalable solutions that drive real business value. At AWS, I work closely with customers to architect innovative cloud-native solutions, driven by my passion for creating tools and systems that enhance developer productivity and success.

I firmly believe in the power of knowledge sharing and continuous learning. You'll often find me speaking at tech conferences around Atlanta, where I enjoy breaking down complex topics and sharing practical insights from the field. I'm also an active contributor to the open-source community, creating and maintaining [projects](/projects) that empower developers in their daily work. When I'm not architecting solutions or speaking at events, I'm probably tinkering with home automation systems or exploring new technologies because there's always something exciting to learn in this field.

The thoughts and content you'll find here are my own, reflecting my personal experiences and perspectives in the ever-evolving world of technology.
