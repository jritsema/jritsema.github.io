My name is John Ritsema and I'm a software developer and architect living in Marietta, Georgia. I like to teach and share things that I've learned and I'm always learning. I've worked as an IT consultant as well as at places like Turner Broadcasting, WarnerMedia and Amazon Web Services (AWS). This site, its content and opinions are my own.
