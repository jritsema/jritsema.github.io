I am passionate about building tools and systems that help developers be more productive and successful. Here is a collection of open-source projects I have created or contributed to over the years, organized by focus area.

## AI
As AI transforms the technology landscape, I have been building tools to help developers leverage these powerful capabilities:

- **[MCP CLI](https://github.com/jritsema/mcp-cli)** - MCP CLI is a tool for managing MCP server configuration files.

- **[Page Insights](https://github.com/jritsema/page-insights)** - Leverage AI to generate intelligent summaries of web pages.

## AWS Containers Expertise
I was an early adopter and advocate for AWS Fargate, creating several widely adopted tools that improved the developer experience:

### Fargate Tooling
- **[Fargate Create CLI](https://github.com/turnerlabs/fargate-create)** - A pioneering CLI tool for scaffolding AWS ECS Fargate applications, featuring an opinionated multi-environment setup and an extensive template library.

- **[Terraform Fargate](https://github.com/jritsema/terraform-fargate)** - Simplified, less opinionated version of fargate-create for Fargate deployments.
- **[Fargate SAM](https://github.com/jritsema/fargate-sam)** - Template for deploying public ALB + ECS Fargate services using CloudFormation and SAM CLI.
- **[Fargate SQS Worker](https://github.com/jritsema/sqs-worker)** - Boilerplate for Fargate containers processing SQS queues.

#### Fargate Infrastructure Templates
A collection of production-grade Terraform templates for AWS container deployments (compatible with the Fargate Create CLI tool):
- **[ALB Template](https://github.com/turnerlabs/terraform-ecs-fargate)** - The gold standard for deploying web applications on Fargate, including logging, observability, and auto-scaling.
